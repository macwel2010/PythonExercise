It was a public holiday, and Mr Tompkins, a little clerk of a big city bank, slept late and had a leisurely breakfast.
Trying to plan his day, he first thought about going to an afternoon movie. 
Opening the local newspaper, he turned to the entertainment page.
But none of the films appealed to him.
He detested the current obsession with sex and violence.
As for the rest, it was the usual holiday fare aimed at children.
If only there were at least one film with some real adventure, with something unusual and maybe challenging about it.
But there was none.
